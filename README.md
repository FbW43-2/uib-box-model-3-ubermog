Exercise:

1. Properly define header and main in your document. For both, use a container with a max-width of 1060px (including 80px padding on each side, remember box-sizing)
2. Divide your main into 2 sections
3. In the first section add an article about a city you like (add a heading and also a nicely-styled "aside" floating on the right side)
4. In the second section add 3 images about that city displayed in one line next to each other (do not use flex). Remember to add an alt.
