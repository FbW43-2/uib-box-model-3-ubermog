        <h1>City 17</h1>
        <p>
          City 17 is a grand city in Eastern Europe that has existed since
          before the Seven Hour War. Later taken over by the Combine, it became
          their main headquarters on Earth. Dominated by the imposing Citadel
          and surrounded by the desolate Wasteland, it is the only location in
          Half-Life 2: Episode One, and one of two major locations in Half-Life
          2. It also made an appearance in Half-Life: Alyx.

            "Welcome! Welcome to City 17! You have chosen, or been chosen, to
            relocate to one of our finest remaining urban centers. I thought so
            much of City 17 that I elected to establish my administration here,
            in the Citadel so thoughtfully provided by our benefactors. I've
            been proud to call City 17 my home. And so, whether you are here to
            stay, or passing through on your way to parts unknown - welcome to
            City 17. It's safer here. " ―Wallace Breen

          The core of the city consists predominately of wall-to-wall buildings,
          with blocks of clustered low-rises made out of a variety of old and
          new buildings. Under Combine rule, certain residential buildings in
          the city are used as accommodations for citizens. Conditions in such
          housings are typically seen as poor, with very few luxuries and
          constant inspection and raids by Civil Protection. However, some city
          infrastructure, such as power plants, are maintained by the Combine,
          and electricity is made widely available from both traditional sources
          and Combine generators. The Combine themselves occupied some former
          government buildings, such as the Overwatch Nexus, to help keep
          control over the city. The city was large enough to provide all
          necessary needs for the citizens before the Combine's occupation. This
          is supported by the presence of a hospital, several cafés and
          restaurants, office buildings, and underground city systems; most of
          which are still intact but abandoned. The outskirts of City 17
          features industrial districts and additional Soviet-style housing,
          most of which are considered off-limits to citizens. The industrial
          districts are seen linked to the city via railway lines and canals. As
          there was little emphasis in maintaining non-essential parts of the
          city, many areas of City 17 suffered from urban decay prior to the
          Citadel's explosion.
